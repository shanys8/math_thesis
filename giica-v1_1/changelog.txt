The first working version of giica does not have a version number.

Version 1.0 (r4)
--  Fixed the demo file demo_quasiorth.m to properly center the
    noise-free data in accordance with the noisy ICA algorithmic
    results.

Version 1.1 (r7)
--  This changelog is now included with the giica source distribution.
--  Adding PEGI algorithm (for pseudo-Euclidean gradient iteration),
    which is a new and improved algorithm intended to replace the
    quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step in GI-ICA.
--  Added SINR optimal demixing option for ICA in the presence of
    Gaussian noise (on by default when using noisy ICA methods, which
    breaks backward compatibility).
