2. cant run experiment with n > 10^7 - matrix to large error - check highest step within runtime
3. c = 12*(n*n) / ((n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)); % should we insert this coef into the sqrt optimization?
4. where to separate to H1, H2 in order for us to be able to approximate - H2 by Z=sqrt(D)*X, H1 by ricatti with D + VV' where V = sqrt(2n-2 / n*n)* [v1,v2,..vm]
