2. cant run experiment with n > 10^7 - matrix to large error - check highest step within runtime
3. c = 12*(n*n) / ((n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)); % should we insert this coef into the sqrt optimization? can try


demo - check results (W should be psd - make sure) - not PSD, also for quasi orth not PSD (I think only H1 is psd by H1-H2 is not)
understand demo
ricatti check big gradients
set u vectors to be const between plain and ricatti - done

sketching add
