2. cant run experiment with n > 10^7 - matrix to large error - check highest step within runtime
3. c = 12*(n*n) / ((n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)); % should we insert this coef into the sqrt optimization? can try


demo - check results - cases that it works and cases that it's not
understand demo
added sketching mat to ricatti - no improvement
check code with same u vectors - two plots - with sketch and wo
