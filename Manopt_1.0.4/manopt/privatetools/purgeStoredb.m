function storedb = purgeStoredb(storedb, storedepth)
% Makes sure the storedb database does not exceed some maximum size.
%
% function storedb = purgeStoredb(storedb, storedepth)
%
% Trim the store database storedb such that it contains at most storedepth
% elements (store structures). The 'lastset' field of the store structures
% is used to delete the oldest elements first.
%
% Known issues: if multiple store's have the same age, because of
% insufficient resolution of the cputime function as compared to the time
% interval between their creation, the storedepth may be exceeded.
